rspamd configuration for SPAM/HAM detection model designed to run even on edge devices based on meta’s Llama 3.2.
This repo will document the steps required to run akritrimai/Llama-SH-GPT ( https://ollama.com/akritrimai/Llama-SH-GPT ) on 
different spam detection platforms. We are starting with a sample  configuration of rspamd's( https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd ) new experimental GPT plugin. It could be made to interact with varied systems as its openai api compatible through ollama.
The model can be pulled from ollams using:

ollama pull akritrimai/Llama-SH-GPT

Coming soon on more platforms!!!
